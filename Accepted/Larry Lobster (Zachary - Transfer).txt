5) True or false: An inmate's treatment should change in regards to their charges, with worse charges receiving more strict treatment. Please elaborate.
                 Nope. They got simple rules to follow while they serve their time in the prison. It would change if they fail to follow those rules while serving time imo.

                 Verbal commands multiple times, if not followed, try to restrain them with the items you have. If they still fail and start trying to attack you, then use your baton to whip them!
