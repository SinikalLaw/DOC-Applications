4| I previously had a cadet on B5M but that is it for here. I had been on a server where I was a cop for around 7-8 months and was a LT in the CHP.

5| I do not think that their overall treatment should get worse no matter who it is. Now, depending on what how long their stay is or their charge may change the privileges throughout the prison that they may get to participate in, but their treatment as a human will not change.

6| I would first try to calm them down. Get them in a good manner just by calming them down and understanding the situation that they are upset about. If that does not work I would try to slowly get them back into their cell that way they can cool off in the cell where they cannot hurt myself or other inmates. If that is not working, may need to escalate force a little bit. 

7| Yes

8| I am really happy to see DOC! I wanted to do it for a while it just wasnt up! I hope that you can review my app and see that I am a fit person for the job. I really want to help make the prison experience much more enjoyable as I have a crim and know how it feels to be in prison for 100's of months and have nothing to do but AFK. Interaction while in prison makes it much more fun and always creates a lot more RP than just AFKing or doing ur job in the jail!
