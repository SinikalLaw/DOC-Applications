6) Detail an appropriate way to deal with an unruly prisoner.
If a Prisoner is unruly first i would try to talk to and try to calm him down so he listens. If he doesnt want to listen to me and would give him 3 warnings before i put him in cuffs. if he starts trying to hit me i would meet his force with either my baton or my bean bag shotgun and place him in cuffs and escort him to his cell and lock it. If he need medical attention i would get him the med ward to get treated.
