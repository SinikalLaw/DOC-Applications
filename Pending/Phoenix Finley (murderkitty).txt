Phoenix Finley

3) How old are you?
31

4) Do you have any law enforcement experience within B5M or elsewhere? Please elaborate.
I do not but I'm eager to get some! I have a bit of EMS experience from a different server where I communicated with law enforcement via radio but it's been a while.

5) True or false: An inmate's treatment should change in regards to their charges, with worse charges recieving more strict treatment. Please elaborate.
True. Even though everyone should be treated equally, if a prisoner is known to have a history of violence they will be needed to handled different. For example, I would remain a safe distance
away from them, but be keeping a closer eye on them to make sure they donâ€™t start or cause any issues with other inmates

6) Detail an appropriate way to deal with an unruly prisoner.
I would start by trying to talk them down. If they're acting out chances are they're upset about something. I would attempt to deescalate the situation all while determining the next move to keep
everyone, including the prisoner, safe.

7) As a member of the Law Enforcement community within B5M, corruption is a server offense. Do you understand that corruption will result in a wipe of your character and dismissal from the department?
Yes

8) Is there any information you would like to add?
I really want this opportunity to create prison RP for criminals. Being in jail can get lonely and I'd love to give crims a reason to do their time instead of changing characters to wait it out.
