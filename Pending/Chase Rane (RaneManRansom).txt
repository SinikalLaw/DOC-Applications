1) Members of the Department of Corrections are met with certain duty requirements and failure to meet these requirements will result in termination. Do you agree to meet these requirements?

Yes. Yes I do.

2) What is your DCR character's name?

Chase Rane

3) How old are you?

30

4) Do you have any law enforcement experience within B5M or elsewhere? Please elaborate.

I have experience within other cities where I was an officer in the LSDP. At one point I was a Sgt. and, very briefly, acting assistant chief of LSPD (this was due to nobody else being able to take on the role)

5) True or false: An inmate's treatment should change in regards to their charges, with worse charges receiving more strict treatment. Please elaborate.

I believe this to be false. Their treatment should be the same as all other inmates, however, a closer eye should be kept on the inmates that are in prison for offences that can be committed within the prison also, such as murder, bodily harm, arson and so on.

6) Detail an appropriate way to deal with an unruly prisoner.

Attempt to talk them down and defuse a situation where possible. If this fails, advise that physical action would need to be taken, then, as a last resort, move to neutralise the inmate, ensuring that the area is clear and safe to do so.

7) As a member of the Law Enforcement community within B5M, corruption is a server offence. Do you understand that corruption will result in a wipe of your character and dismissal from the department?

Absolutely.

8) Is there any information you would like to add?

I love you long time, Sin and friends.
